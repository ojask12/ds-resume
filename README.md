## Projects: 
* [Santander Customer Satisfaction](https://github.com/ojask12/Predict-Customer-Satisfaction) <br>
_Santander Bank has provided information collected throughout the customer journey and the associated end of journey outcome of customer satisfaction. <br>
The bank has anonymized the features provided. The task is to identify high impact predictors which will be of great use for the bank. <br>
•	Analysed a highly imbalanced dataset (majority customer satisfied) with 370 anonymized predictors and implemented <br>
Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Trees to predict customer satisfaction with bank’s services accurately. <br>
•	Applying permutation importance on the best model identified the features that are most important for prediction. <br>
Santander Bank Ltd can use these and focus more on strong areas & improve weaker areas.<br>
•	Best results were obtained with gradient boosted tree model which gave an AUC score of 0.9692. <br>
Sklearn, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Bagging, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, kNN classifier_
